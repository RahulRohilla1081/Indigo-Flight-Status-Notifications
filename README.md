## Tech Stack
### Backend: 
`Python` (Utilized frameworks and libraries for efficient event handling and real-time processing.)
### Frontend: 
`React JS` (Built a user-friendly interface for real-time flight tracking.)
### Message Broker: 
`RabbitMQ` (Managed event queues for notifications, ensuring reliability and scalability.)
### SMS Notification: 
`Twilio` integrated as the SMS provider. Ensured reliable and timely delivery of SMS notifications to end-users.
### Web Sockets: 
Enabled real-time communication between the backend and frontend applications.
### Database: 
`MongoDB` Managed complex data efficiently, supporting real-time queries and updates

## Business Benefits
### Real-Time Tracking: 
Users can track flights in `real-time`, enhancing the `user experience`.

### Efficient Notifications: 
Ensured timely delivery of critical notifications through `RabbitMQ`.

### Scalability: 
The system can grow with the business needs, handling more users and events without sacrificing performance.
### Data Integrity:
Prevented data loss by queuing messages and ensuring `reliable delivery`.

## Summary
Developed a robust flight tracking system to provide real-time flight status updates and notifications to
passengers. The system provides live updates on flight positions, statuses, and estimated arrival/departure times etc. It displays real-time flight information on an user-friendly dashboard, allowing users to track flights visually. 
Advanced Search and Filtering enables users to search for flights by `PNR number`.
Focused on `scalability`, `reliability`, and `real-time data synchronization` to provide an exceptional user experience.
