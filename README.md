## Tech Stack
### Backend: 
`Python` (Utilized frameworks and libraries for efficient event handling and real-time processing.)
### Frontend: 
`React JS` (Built a user-friendly interface for real-time flight tracking.)
### Message Broker: 
`RabbitMQ` (Managed event queues for notifications, ensuring reliability and scalability.)
### SMS Notification: 
`Twilio` integrated as the SMS provider. Ensured reliable and timely delivery of SMS notifications to end-users.
### Web Sockets: 
Enabled real-time communication between the backend and frontend applications.
### Database: 
`MongoDB` Managed complex data efficiently, supporting real-time queries and updates

## Business Benefits
### Real-Time Tracking: 
Users can track flights in `real-time`, enhancing the `user experience`.

### Efficient Notifications: 
Ensured timely delivery of critical notifications through `RabbitMQ`.

### Scalability: 
The system can grow with the business needs, handling more users and events without sacrificing performance.
### Data Integrity:
Prevented data loss by queuing messages and ensuring `reliable delivery`.

## Summary
Developed a robust flight tracking system to provide real-time flight status updates and notifications to
passengers. The system provides live updates on flight positions, statuses, and estimated arrival/departure times etc. It displays real-time flight information on an user-friendly dashboard, allowing users to track flights visually. 
Advanced Search and Filtering enables users to search for flights by `PNR number`.
Focused on `scalability`, `reliability`, and `real-time data synchronization` to provide an exceptional user experience.

In this React.js business application, following screens are there:  

`Dashboard`

`Search PNR`

`Flights create, update(Admin)`  

`Aircrafts,(Admin)`  

`Airports,(Admin)`  

 

`Dashboard`

In dashboard passengers can see information i.e. STD (Scheduled Time of Departure), Airline, Flight no., destination, Status in real time. Any update in any flight data by admin leads to real time update of the dashboard screen data. 

`Search PNR` 

From the navigator panel on Left Hand Side, Click on Search PNR.  
In search PNR screen, passengers can enter their PNR number in search input box to get the itinerary data like Departure airport, destination airport, Flight timing, gate number, flight number, terminal. The details are generated for each passenger travelling under that PNR. 

`Flight Create, update â€“ Admin Access:`  

Click on flights on navigator panel. 

To access this screen, ID and password is required. 

After login, Admin will able to view the flights details in tabular format, in which there will be flight details like scheduled timing,  actual timing, gate number, terminal, airports details, status.  

Admin can create new flight by selecting the aircraft, timings of departure and arrival, departure airport and destination airport, gate number and terminal.  
On every flight data there are buttons to update the flight details, like, timings, status changes, gate or terminal changes.  

Every time flight updated, a log is generated and can be viewed by clicking on the history button. All previous data and new data is listed in history in tabular format.  

Also this action will trigger the event and notification will be sent to passengers via email as well as SMS in case of any update in flight delays, flight early departure, gate or terminal changes, diverted etc 

But admin can change flight status like Boarding, Departed, In Air, Landed etc. for internal purpose.  

`Aircrafts:`  

Admin can add new aircrafts data if indigo adds new aircrafts in the fleet.  

`Airports:`  

Admin can add/manage the airports details like airport name, IATA Code, ICAO Code, City, Country.  

`Summary of Architecture:`   

I used an event-driven architecture approach to make the application scalable, reliable, Resilient and real-time processing   

I have implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to separate the admin screens from the passenger screens. RBAC is used to secure admin access with passwords while allowing anyone to search and view flight data. 

In this react.js business application I created Screen to manage flight delays, gate changes, terminal changes, flight diversions. Whenever Admin updates the flight, a event will be generated, that event will be pushed into Queue (RabbitMQ ) then that event will be consumed, and notification will be sent to passenger.  

To achieve this, I used RabbitMQ, I created event producer (React JS website) and consumer( RabbitMQ Consumer) as separate services for notifications (Email and SMS) All the flights changes pushed to a queue in RabbitMQ then from that queue consumer will send notification to passengers. This approach will help in case of server downtime! We will not lose any data of notification. Whenever our server will be up, email and SMS notification will be sent to passengers.  

Also, this also triggers the web socket and web socket will send the updated flight details in dashboard in real-time.  

I have written the backend in python and used MongoDB as database for flexibility and scalability. I Created a python server to create REST APIs and implemented web sockets with the help of FastAPI package in python.  

I used pymongo package to implement queries in MongoDB to get the data from database like flights-list, create flight data, update flight data.   

I used Twilio to send the SMS and smtplib package to send the email notification from support email id to passengers.  

Case Study Summary: 

Admin logs in and updates flight data. Real time data gets updated in dashboard accordingly.  

For every update in flight records, respective passengers receive automatic notifications through email as well as SMS. 

 Even if the server stops during this process, the notification process stays the MQRabbit queue and the process gets completed immediately when the server restarts. In this way, no processes are lost even if the server stops suddenly and it is ensured that the passengers get timely notifications without fail.
